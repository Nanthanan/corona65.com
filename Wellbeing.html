               Supplement tests in mice to boost gut bacteria may help in fight against Alzheimer's. 
               A US study, soon to undergo a clinical trial, has found evidence that a health gut can reduce 
               the risk of developing "alzheimer's" in mice.
               The Mice were given a prebiotic supplement called <b>R13</b> to promote diversity of gut microbes,
               the treated mice accumulated less of the protein associated with Alzheimer's.

                The antimicrobial properties of honey could be used in dressings for wounds. 
                Honey is also an anti-inflammatory, reducing the swelling and preventing infection, thereby reducing scarring.
                however, diabetic patients should be monitored for blood glucose if receving honey dressings.

                <p> <b>Immunity:</b> </br> it seems that now, more than ever, we are lookiing to keep our <b>immune systems</b> in tip-top condition.
            while the <b>immune system</b> does a rather good job at protecting us, there are many things we can do to help keep such a complex system working effectively.

                Every part of the body, including the <b>immune syetem</b>, functions better with a healthy lifestyle.
                Maitaining a healthy weight, eating plenty of fruit and vegetables, having a regular exercise routine,
                moderating your alcohol intake, and getting enough sleep can all contribute to a healthy body. </p>

                    70-80% of the body's <b>immune cells</b> are found in the <b>gut</b>, so maintaining a healthy digestive system can directly
                    affect how the <b>immune system</b> responds to threats. Probiotics can help to restore healthy levels of <b>gut bacteria</b>. 
                    Probiotics can be found in fermented foods such as <b>kimchi,sauerraut or cultured yoghurt</b>, but are also available as a supplement. 
                    Prebiotics and dietary fibre are equally as important to maintain a suitable environment for the healthy bacteria.

                    weaken the immune system. Stress can affect the digestive system and heart health, both of which contribute to healthy immune system.
